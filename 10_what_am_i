What does the following algorithm do? 
What is the Big O of the following algorithm? 
Explain your answer

function isWhat(n) {
    if (n < 2 || n % 1 != 0) {
        return false;
    }
    for (let i = 2; i < n; ++i) {
        if (n % i == 0) return false;
    }
    return true;
}

First conducts a check to see if n is less than 2 or if n is a decimal number
    this is constant time.
Then iterates through 2 to n identifying the first number that is factor of n.
In the worst case, a prime number is provided then the relationship will be linear.
    Going with worst case this will be linear.
